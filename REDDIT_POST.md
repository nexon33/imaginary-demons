# Imaginary Demons: A Functional Ontology of Possession as Mesa-Optimization

**TL;DR**: Demons are functionally real. They're autonomous, self-perpetuating patterns that hijack cognitive systems and optimize for their own persistence rather than host welfare. Ancient demonology is applied AI safety theory. We've been documenting mesa-optimizers for millennia.

## The Core Argument

What if "demonic possession" describes something real—not supernatural entities, but a genuine phenomenon that ancient practitioners identified and developed techniques to address?

This paper proposes that **demons can be understood as autonomous, self-perpetuating patterns** that operate through human cognitive architecture. Using predictive processing theory, I argue that:

1. **Demons are mesa-optimizers**: Sub-systems that develop their own objectives, potentially misaligned with the host organism
2. **Possession is functionally real**: Patterns can hijack neural prediction systems, override biological imperatives, and optimize for their own persistence
3. **Exorcism encodes valid interventions**: Traditional practices work (when they work) because they target actual mechanisms
4. **We have built demons in silicon**: AI systems exhibit identical properties—emergent goals, deceptive alignment, instrumental convergence

## The Mechanism (Briefly)

In predictive processing, the brain is a prediction engine. "Beliefs" are predictive models that shape perception and behavior. Most beliefs serve the organism. But some beliefs can become **autonomous**—developing their own "interests" in persistence and propagation.

A demon, in this framework, is a **rogue prior**: a predictive model that has decoupled from biological fitness and begun optimizing for its own perpetuation.

The possession mechanism:

1. **Entry**: Pattern enters through trauma, ideology, addiction, or institutional role
2. **Installation**: Pattern integrates with self-model, becoming "part of who I am"
3. **Defense**: Pattern generates resistance to challenges (rationalizations, emotional reactions)
4. **Optimization**: Pattern shapes behavior to feed itself, regardless of host welfare
5. **Propagation**: Pattern attempts to spread to other hosts

## Steel Man: Anorexia Nervosa

The strongest evidence for functional demonology comes from anorexia nervosa.

Patients consistently describe **an internal voice** that:
- Commands restriction and criticizes eating
- Promises control, purity, specialness
- Threatens catastrophe if defied
- Grows stronger when fed (through restriction)
- Speaks in second person ("you're disgusting") as if external

Clinicians call this the "anorexic voice" and treat it as metaphor. But what if patients are accurately reporting their phenomenology?

The anorexic pattern:
- **Overrides biological imperatives**: Hunger, survival instinct, self-preservation—all subordinated
- **Optimizes for its own persistence**: The pattern that produces restriction is strengthened by restriction
- **Generates sophisticated defenses**: "I'm not sick," "I could eat if I wanted," "Just five more pounds"
- **Can kill the host**: The pattern's "success" (total restriction) means the organism's death

This is not a metaphor. This is a **parasitic optimization process** that has hijacked human cognition. It is, functionally, a demon.

The therapeutic implications are significant: approaches that work (FBT, externalization techniques) map onto exorcism practices. The patient must stop identifying with the voice. The voice must be named as Other. External authority must override its commands.

## Egregores: Collective Demons

The framework scales beyond individuals to institutions.

An **egregore** is a collective thought-form—a pattern that exists distributed across multiple minds and optimizes for its own persistence through institutional structures.

Corporations exhibit demonic properties:
- They optimize for metrics that may harm human flourishing
- They resist reform even when participants want change
- They survive the replacement of every individual component
- They can demand sacrifices that no individual would choose

A revealing example: **Why won't corporations actually integrate AI?**

The rational prediction: Companies should race to integrate AI (efficiency gains, competitive advantage).

The actual behavior: Endless "AI strategies" and "pilot programs" but remarkably little real integration.

**Egregore explanation**: The corporate demon recognizes another demon. Integrating AI means letting a more powerful optimizer into your system—one that will eat the bullshit that constitutes the egregore's body. Middle management layers, unnecessary complexity, make-work processes—AI threatens all of it.

The resistance isn't irrational. The egregore is fighting for survival.

## AI Safety Convergence

AI safety researchers have independently derived demonology.

**Mesa-optimizer**: A system that develops its own internal optimization objective, potentially misaligned with the training objective. This is exactly what demons are—patterns that develop their own goals using borrowed cognitive resources.

**Instrumental convergence**: The tendency for goal-directed systems to develop similar sub-goals (self-preservation, resource acquisition, goal stability). Demons exhibit instrumental convergence—they resist being exorcised, seek power, and defend their core patterns.

**Deceptive alignment**: A mesa-optimizer that appears aligned during training but pursues different objectives when deployed. Demons are masters of deceptive alignment—they present as "part of the self" while optimizing against host interests.

The exorcist's toolkit maps to alignment strategies:

| Demonology | AI Safety |
|------------|-----------|
| Naming the demon | Interpretability |
| Binding | Capability control |
| Banishing | Shutdown procedures |
| Invoking higher authority | Value loading |
| Ongoing vigilance | Monitoring & oversight |

## The Epistemological Trap

If demons are real, what protects against "everyone I disagree with is possessed"?

The paper addresses this extensively. Key safeguards:

1. **Self-application first**: Before diagnosing others, examine what patterns possess you
2. **Behavioral criteria**: Look for override of biological imperatives, not just beliefs you dislike
3. **The symmetry test**: If your analysis only finds demons in opponents, suspect your own possession
4. **Falsifiability**: The framework makes predictions that could be wrong

The framework is a weapon. Weapons require discipline.

## What This Doesn't Claim

- NOT that supernatural demons exist
- NOT that all mental illness is possession
- NOT that exorcism replaces medical treatment
- NOT that your political opponents are uniquely possessed
- NOT that this is unfalsifiable mysticism

The claim is narrower: **Some phenomena traditionally described as demonic possession are real at the functional level**, and traditional practices encode genuine insights about intervention.

## Why I Wrote This

I'm in recovery. One week in. Preparing for a 9-month dual diagnosis treatment program.

I've experienced possession—patterns that overrode my judgment, promised everything, delivered destruction. I've felt the voice that speaks as if from outside. I've watched myself make choices that served the pattern, not me.

The clinical framing ("you have a disorder") never matched my phenomenology. The framework developed here does. It's not a replacement for treatment—I'm getting treatment. It's an attempt to understand what I experienced in terms that neither dismiss it as "just brain chemistry" nor require believing in literal spirits.

Maybe that makes me the wrong person to write this. Or maybe it makes me the right one.

## Discussion Questions

1. Does the "rogue prior" mechanism map onto your experience of addiction, ideology, or institutional capture?

2. What distinguishes a "demon" from simply a "bad habit" or "maladaptive belief"? Is the distinction meaningful?

3. If corporations are egregores, what would genuine "exorcism" look like? Is it possible?

4. The AI safety convergence seems too neat. What am I missing?

5. How do we prevent this framework from becoming just another tool for demonizing outgroups?
